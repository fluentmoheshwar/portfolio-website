## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

All layouts are stored in `/src/layouts`

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where I like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte components.

Blog posts are stored in `src/content/posts`

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
