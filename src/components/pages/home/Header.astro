      Meet Moheshwar Amarnath Biswas

      Hey, I'm Moheshwar.
      A student who likes building stuff that actually works and tossing around ideas that catch on.
      I got into coding when I was seven (yeah, I was that kid), just because I loved making my own things.
      Over time, I picked up Python, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript basically collecting tools like they're Pok√©mon.
      I'm super curious about how Bangladesh fits into the bigger global scene, especially where tech and trade bump into each other.
      Whether it's an app, a new strategy, or some wild business concept, I'm all about creating things that connect people and actually stick around.
